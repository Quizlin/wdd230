        Notes:<br><br>

        * Went over the basics are html in the "doing_stuff_with_web_things" pdf.<br>
        * Read and Created the index.html Portfolio.<br>
        * created the story_edior html code and uploaded it.<br>
        * Watched Master Mobile UX<br> <br>
        *** "If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple nor beautiful."<br>
        <br>*** In 2007 Smart Phones exploded on the market. They surpased PC's in only 4 years.<br><br>
        *** Now most people in the house hold will have 2 or more devices. <br><br>
        *** Mobile sites are a must these days <br><br>
        
        <br>Question:<br><br>

        * Back in the early 2000's technology was not "cool", why has it sparked so much interest with everyone these days?
