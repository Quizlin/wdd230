        Notes:<br><br>

        * Group meeting on Friday - Not very productive - Still required many hours of my own research before and after to do the assignment.<br><br>
        * Tic-Tac-Toe - Found a differnt way to create the board using "If" statements.<br><br>
        * Box code<br>
        * Self Reminder note:<br><br>
        const drawBoard = () => {<br>
          boxes.forEach((box, i) => {<br>
            let styleString = '';<br>
            if (i < 3) {<br>
              styleString += 'border-bottom: 3px solid var(--text);';<br>
            }<br><br>
        * Learned how to create other "If" statments to check after each move if the game was done and show the winner.<br><br>
       Self Reminder note:<br><br>
        if (spaces[0] === currentPlayer) {<br>
          if (spaces[1] === currentPlayer && spaces[2] === currentPlayer) {<br>
            strategy.innerText = `${currentPlayer} wins up on top`;<br>
            return true;<br><br>
        
        * Draw Code
            * Self Reminder note:<br><br>

        const playerDraw = () => {<br>
          let draw = 0;<br>
          spaces.forEach((space, i) => {<br>
            if (spaces[i] !== null) draw++;<br>
          });<br>
          if (draw === 9) {<br>
            text.innerText = `Cats Game! (Draw)`;<br>
          }<br>
        };<br><br>

        * Read the chapters<br>
        * Notes:<br>
        * Not quite sure what notes to write for the reading - If I have any questions or confusions I refer back to the book.<br><br>


        * Comparing Code:<br>
            * Self Reminder Notes:<br><br>
            * Was unfamilar with "nth-child" - reviewed the teachers code example and have a better understanding.<br>
            * See Saved copy of example for future reference. <br>
            * See "HTML Examples - W3Schools" website for better understanding.

        <br>Question:<br><br>

        1. Why do we have the group meetings? I feel like they are not worth the effort and time scheduling. We were only able to get <br>
        through the basic frame of the board in the hour. I still have to spend hours on my own figuring the code out.
