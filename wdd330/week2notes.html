        * Joined group 1<br><br>
        * Went over this weeks group work and group chat logs.<br><br>
        * Familiarized myself with the code.<br><br>
        * Bought Sitepoint Premium Access Code, still waiting for it to arrive in email.<br><br>
        *** Therefore I have not been able to read the chapters yet, but I will catch up on the reading as soon as get it.
        <br><br>
        
        * Based on the Chapter discriptions - it seems like review on the last course so I feel confident I'll be able to catch up.

         * Read the alternative readings.<br><br>
