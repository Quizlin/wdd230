      <h2>CIT 330: Week 3 Notes</h2>
      <ul>

        Notes:<br><br>

        * Did our group 1 work on Friday.<br><br>
        * Went over this weeks group work and group chat logs.<br><br>
        * Read the chapters<br><br>
        * Signed up for the javascrip 30 - Bit confusing. <br><br>
        * Got help from team to understand how to do the group work assignment - Bit confusing. <br><br>
        *Watched the array video, very helpful. I learn best by watching how something works rather then <br><br>
        reading a book.<br><br>
        
         <br><br>
   


    
        
        <br>Question:<br><br>

        * Not really a question - comment: The instruction for this weeks activty were hard to understand and follow. Finding the assignment in the consol
        <br> and signup process for the website were a little confusing. <br><br>
