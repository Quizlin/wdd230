******************************************<br><br>
Temporary Variables        <br><br>
This process requires the use of a temporary variable, called temp, which only exists while the IIFE is invoked:

Copy
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

(()=>{
    const temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
})();

a;
<< 2

b;
<< 1
<br><br>
console.log(temp);
<< Error: "temp is not defined"<br><br>
This shows the variable temp does not exist after the function has been invoked.

Note that this technique is not needed to swap the values of two variables in ES6, as destructuring can be used, as shown below:
<br><br>
Copy
let [a,b] = [1,2];
[a,b] = [b,a];<br><br>

a;
<< 2

b;
<< 1 <br><br>

Note: refer back to this chapter 11 for examples on how to code functions of <br>
math, arrays and returning other functions. <br><br>

The XMLHttpRequest object was finally standardized by the WHATWG and W3C as part of the HTML5 specification,<br> despite it originally being implemented by Microsoft many years earlier, and already available in most browsers.

        <br>Question:<br><br>

    No questions this week. Things are going ok. Notes are not long since not much reading.
    I read over all the chapters and my own research to get the assignment working this week.
    Took a while to get the new hiking app working.
